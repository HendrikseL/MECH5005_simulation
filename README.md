# MECH5005_simulation

## Requirements
- MATLAB version: 2023b
- MATLAB / Simulink libraries
    - Aerospace Toolbox
    - Aerospace Blockset
    - Embedded Coder
    - Phased Array System Toolbox
    - Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox
    - Simulink 3D Animation
    - Simulink Coder
    - UAV Toolbox


## Architecture
    -To run the simulation open main. the user inputs will be automatically loaded, from there controls can be made.
    -default waypoints correspond to the raster scan pattern for the project, however any waypoints can be used.
    -designate first way point as GCS location

    -some simulink harnesses are unused, in future the logic in main will be ported to these additional harnesses. The data dictionaries should be set up to enable this transition.
